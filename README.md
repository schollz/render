# render

using 2x norns to "render" the op-z songs.

op-z sequences are routed through norns into other hardware (+supercollider) using midi, crow, and osc. 

each mono audio from hardware is then patched back into the 2x norns into L/R.

each of the norns then continuously records the stereo audio (L/R tracks are different instrumnet).
